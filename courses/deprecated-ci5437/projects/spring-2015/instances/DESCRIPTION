Each files called instances.dist=XX contains 100 random instances
generated from the goal at distance <= XX

Each file called output.<alg>.dist=XX contains solutions for the
instances in file instances.dist=XX

The format of the output file is as follow. There is an output line
for each input instances in the instances file. The line contains:

- the instance, 
- the value of the heuristic for the initial state (- if the algorithm
doesn't use heuristics),
- the cost of an optimal path from the initial state to a goal state,
- the number of states generated,
- total time to solve the instance in seconds, and
- number of nodes generated per second.
